MEDIQA @ NAACL-BioNLP 2021 -- Task 1: Consumer Health Question Summarization  

https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021


Training Data: The [MeQSum Dataset](https://github.com/abachaa/MeQSum) of consumer health questions and their summaries could be used for training. Participants can use available external resources, including, but not limited to [medical QA datasets](https://github.com/abachaa/Existing-Medical-QA-Datasets) and question focus & type recognition datasets. For instance, the [CHQs Dataset](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-018-2045-1.pdf?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com) contains additional annotations (e.g. medical entities, question focus, question type, keywords) of the MeQSum questions.  

The validation and test sets consist of consumer health questions received by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM)  in December 2020 and their associated summaries, manually created by experts in medical informatics. 

The validation set will be available on January 29, 2021. 

The test set will be available for the registered participants with the official MEDIQA 2021 test sets on [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mediqa-2021/problems/mediqa-2021-question-summarization-qs), under the [Resources](https://www.aicrowd.com/clef_tasks/41/task_dataset_files?challenge_id=644) section.
