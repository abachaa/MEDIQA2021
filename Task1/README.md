https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021


**Training Data**

The [MeQSum Dataset](https://github.com/abachaa/MeQSum) of consumer health questions and their summaries could be used for training. 

Participants can use available external resources, including, but not limited to [medical QA datasets](https://github.com/abachaa/Existing-Medical-QA-Datasets) and question focus & type recognition datasets. 

For instance, the [CHQs Dataset](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12859-018-2045-1.pdf?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com) contains additional annotations (e.g. medical entities, question focus, question type, keywords) of the MeQSum questions.  

**Validation and test sets** 

Consist of consumer health questions received by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) in December 2020 and their associated summaries, manually created by medical experts. 

- The **validation set** is available [here](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task1/MEDIQA2021-Task1-QuestionSummarization-ValidationSet.xlsx). It contains 50 NLM questions and their summaries. We also provided additional information (question focus and type) with the summaries. 

- Please note that in the official test set, we will **not provide** the question focus and type for the test questions. Also, the **test questions** of the Question Summarization and Answer Summarization tasks will be different.  

- The **test set** is available [here](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task1/MEDIQA2021-Task1-TestSet-ReferenceSummaries.xlsx). It contains 100 consumer health questions and their reference summaries.
