5||Chronic persistent cough can be caused by inflammation, allergies and many other diseases.  Your doctor will prescribe treatments for the disease. For example, if you have allergies, your doctor may recommend antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. Treatments for cough are used only if the reason is unknown or it causes severe discomfort.
24||Causes of brain calcification can be determined using biochemical analysis of blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. One of the causes is a genetic disorder called primary familial brain calcification (PFBC)  with characteristic calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. This disorder is frquently caused by mutations in SLC20A2 and  PDGFRB genes.  If other causes of calcification are eliminated, genetic testing for PFBC is recommended. There are no treatments for PFBC. Medications are used to treat the symptoms, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. 
38||Recovery from GBS could take weeks, months, or even years. If the symptoms clear within 3 weeks, the outlook is likely good. Some mild weakness could linger up to three years. In some cases, severe complications, such as respiratory failure or permanent paralysis are possible.
94||Treatments depend on the symptoms. If you have only minor symptoms, self-care steps are often enough. A yearly exam is needed to see if you need changes in treatment. SELF-CARE includes urinating  on a timed schedule,,avoiding alcohol and caffeine, spreading out small portions of fluids during the day, keeping warm and exercising regularly. Avoid stress and cold and sinus medicines, which contain decongestants or antihistamine  that can increase BPH symptoms.  Some studies show that saw palmetto may reduce the symptoms. Other herbs have been tried with mixed results. Drug treatments include Alpha-1 blockers that ease urination by relaxing the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. Finasteride and dutasteride reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH.
95||Most machines are safe to use with a pacemaker. Some devices should be kept at least 12 inches away. These include  battery powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills) Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws) Electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers Slot machines Stereo speakers Some medical equipment may interfere with your pacemaker.Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment, Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers Large electrical- or gasoline-powered appliances. Do not put your cell phone in a pocket  or to the ear on the same side as your pacemaker.
97||Sensorineural deafness is caused by the damage to the inner ear, the auditory nerve or the brain. Although it cannot be reversed, some hearing aids can help you hear better. If the damage is severe, a cochlear implant might be placed under the skin behind the ear. This hearing device converts the sound to electrical signal and sends tit o the brain. The sound is not the same as in normal hearing, but it helps communicating.
102||There is no cure for  transverse myelitis. Treatments for the symptoms usually start with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. NSAIDs reduce inflammation and help managing pain. Other treatments include immunoglobulin injections, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and other medicines that modify immune response, These drugs should be given by an oncologist. About a third of the people recovers completely. Some could develop long-term bowel problems and permanent disabilities. Physical and occupational therapy could help manage the disabilities.
103||Vision lost due to glaucoma cannot be restored, but the progression of the disease can be prevented by daily treatments with special eye drops that lower the pressure in the eyes.
105||Dementia could be caused by many different diseases of the brain. it is diagnosed if at least two brain functions are effected, for example, if people experience memory loss and changes in behavior and personality. Diagnostic tests for dementia include family history, physical examination, and neurological tests to asses balance, sensory functions, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and cognitive functions. In many cases, the type of dementia is confirmed after the person dies.
110||Some forms of  acrocallosal syndrome are not inherited, These cases occur due to mutations during early embryo development. The inherited form of acrocallosal syndrome is autosomal recessive, which means both parents have to pass the mutations to the child and  both copies of the child's gene in each cell have mutations.
115||It is still not clear for how long people can spread COVID-19. It is known that people can start spreading it two days before the symptoms appear and for 10 days after the symptoms start. Alternatively, people can spread the virus for 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen) is not recommended to stop isolation, unless people are severly immunocompromised. 
116||To reduce swelling, keep your arms and legs above your heart level when you are lying down, so that the swelling can drain. If you are experiencing shortness of breath, call your doctor immediately. Continue with your everyday activities to help draining the fluids. Exercise your legs, reduce salt in your diet to reduce fluid retention, wear support stockings, and void tight clothes. 
117||It is hard to predict when the next influenza pandemic might occur. Several outbreaks in 1957, 1968 and 2009 effected millions of people. World Health Organization works with the national governments to build preparedness for the next pandemic, including improved modeling and forecasting of influenza and new vaccines.
119||Your doctor might advise against taking Zoledronic Acid if you havre kidney problems; have trouble absorbing minerals in your stomach; are pregnant or breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant; had surgery that removed your parathyroid or thyroid glands, or part of the intestines;  if you are sensitive to aspirin, cannot take calcium supplements, have low blood calcium. People with scleroderma have calcium deposits in their tissues.
121||Usually  Cefuroxime is taken twice daily, i.e. every 12 hours.
122||Environmental, life-style and hereditary factors can increase the risk of cancer. For some cancers, risk factors are gene damage or cancer genes that run in the family. For many cancers, exposure to chemical s plays a major role. These chemicals include tobacco smoke, asbestos, radon, benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride. Sunlight, alcohol, lack of physical activity, being overweight or obese, and taking hormones are also risk factors for different cancers. For women, never  having a full-term pregnancy, having the first pregnancy after 30 and not breastfeeding are risk factors for breast cancer. Geographical location might play a role due to exposure to environmental risks and genetic predisposition.
125||Many body parts are effected by systemic  lupus erythematosus. It is an autoimmune disease, which means the immune system destroys your own body tissues in the skin, joints, heart, lung, kidneys, circulating blood cells, and brain. Lupus can cause kidney failure and heart disease.
129||Make sure the bag is below your waist so that urine is not going back into the bladder. Keep the catheter connected and check for kinks and move it around if it is not draining. Drink enough water to keep urine flowing.
131||Numbness and tingling in the feet could be caused by nerve damage due to diabetes. Nerve damage can also lower your ability fo feel heat or cold, which could lead complications. To prevent complications, keep the blood sugar  in the target range.
133||If the injury occurred during a crash and if it is bleeding, stop the bleeding first by applying direct pressure, cover the area with  a wet cloth and elevate the injured area above the heart level. Call the local emergency number, as the injury should be evaluated  in an emergency department, and surgery, sling, splint or cast may be needed. In other cases, you doctor will most likely to follow RICE: Rest you elbow, Ice it for 15-20 minutes. Compress the area with an elastic bandage. Elevate the elbow above the heart level. You might need ibuprofen or naproxen for pain.
136||Abdominal pain cam be caused by many conditions. In many cases yo do not need to call your doctor, for example, if the pain is caused by gas. If the symptoms continue, call your doctor. Sometimes abdominal pain is caused by the problems in other areas, for example, urinary tract infection. If you have pain and burning sensation while urinating, call your doctor.
140||The risk factors for depression are genetic (family history), biological, environmental and psychological. Life experiences, such as trauma, loss of a family member or financial problems could cause stress and depression. Changes in the body and brain become a factor as the person ages or experiences onset of an illness, such as Parkinson disease.  Women are more likely to have depression, particularly if they are African-American, Hispanic, or white, and if they live below the poverty line. Some forms of depression are caused by specific factors, such as postpartum depression during and after pregnancy, depression with psychosis or other mental illness, seasonal affective disorder due to lack of sunlight during the winter, and some medications or viruses or thyroid disorders.  Depression is diagnosed if the systems persist for at least two weeks. The examination by a mental health professional includes questions about the symptoms, life experiences and emotions. Although there are no tests to confirm depression, the doctor may order some tests to determine if the symptoms are caused by a hormonal or other physical disorder.
141||A randomized clinical trial has shown the the high dose flu vaccine that contains four times more antigen than the regular vaccine had better effectiveness in older people. The stronger vaccines FLUAD,  FLUAD Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are licensed only for peopler 65 and older in the United States. Ask your doctor which vaccine is right for you.
142||All pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. If a  woman cannot produce enough insulin to offset the resistance, she develops gestational diabetes. The high levels of glucose in the blood caused by this condition are not good for the baby. To protect the baby's health, the blood glucose levels have to be managed immediately.
143||Side effects and drug allergies are unwanted reactions to taking drugs. Some of the reactions, e.g., anaphylaxis, are uncommon but could be life-threatening.  Metoprolol may cause serious side effects. You have to call your doctor if you experience shortness of breath, wheezing, fainting or rapid, pounding, or irregular heartbeat.
144||Lactic acid  builds up in the body when the blood pressure  is low and cells do not have enough oxygen for metabolism. Accumulation of lactic acid in the bloodstream causes lactic acidosis. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary lactic acidosis. Other causes include AIDS, alcoholism, cancer, cirrhosis,  cyanide poisoning, kidney failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Some medications, e.g. Metformin, which is used to treat diabetes, could cause lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis is treated by addressing the condition that caused it.
145||Liver and bile effect cholesterol levels. Liver makes cholesterol, whereas bile acids are needed to absorb fat from blood. If the food contains saturated fat and cholesterol, blood cholesterol levels rise. To lower cholesterol levels, your doctor may prescribe statins that block the liver from making cholesterol or bile acid sequestrants that decrease the absorption of fats from food.
148||Heart attack occurs when the blood supply to a section of the heart muscle is blocked. If the blood flow is not restored with treatment, this part of the heart muscle begins to die and more damage occurs over time. People who had a heart attack, may have another one. Sometimes the symptoms of heart attack are mild, and sometimes angina symptoms can be confused with heart attack. Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by insufficient blood supply to the heart. It can be relieved with rest or angina medications.
151||Proteins in a vegetarian diet come mostly from plants. It is important to eat different foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and, for some people, dairy and eggs. Fortified cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and fruit juices are recommended to get the necessary nutrients.  Foods containing large amounts of sugar and salt are not recommended. Proteins should be included with every meal. You might also need supplements, e.g., iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.  Consult a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients.
152||Cri-du-chat syndrome could be inherited or caused by a random mutation that  results in the intellectual disability and health problems. The syndrome is called  cri-du-chat because one of the symptoms is a characteristic high-pitched, mewing cry that sounds like a kitten crying. This cry starts after birth and lasts several weeks before disappearing. The symptoms also include a low birth weight and a small head with  a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes, and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. The infant may seem limp and have webbed fingers and toes and heart defects.
153||Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a chronic disorder.that usually affects older adults.  Sometimes there are no symptoms. Some of the  symptoms related to thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity).are caused by high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the blood. Hyperviscosity of the blood may cause nosebleeds, headaches, dizziness, and blurring or loss of vision. Other common symptoms include weakness, appetite loss, weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, fever, Raynaud's phenomenon, and mental status changes. Other symptoms of Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are caused by accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in different tissues, which can lead to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), shortage of normal blood cells (pancytopenia) and reduction in red blood cells (anemia).
155||Macular degeneration almost always starts with the dry form. The dry form, which accounts for 85-90% of all cases, occurs due to a deposit of yellowish substance under the retina. In 10-15% of people the dry form progresses to the wet form, which is caused by abnormal  fragile blood vessels growing under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid causing vision loss.
158||Ileostomy stools change depending on the foods you eat. If a certain food causes changes, do not it ir for a while, and then try again. If your discharge smells bad, call you doctor immediately.
160||Diabetes is  caused by high levels of blood sugar. The blood sugar levels are high either if  your body does not make insulin or it does not use insulin right. Insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas, helps the glucose from food get into your body's cells for energy. There are two main types of diabetes, each with its own risk factors and potential causes. In diabetes type 1, the body makes little or no insulin.  Most likely, the cause is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system  attacks and destroys pancreatic cells that produce insulin. It can be triggered by an infection  or some medications. Some foods may raise  the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example,  early exposure to cows milk and cereals in infants may increase risk.  In type 2 diabetes, which is more common, the body is resistant to insulin, i.e., it is not used properly and the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the inability to use insulin.
161||There are many forms of non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma and life expectancy depends on the specific type and response to treatment. Some forms, e.g., BL, are rapidly fatal without treatment or if they don't go into remission. Some forms progress slowly. One of the slow growing forms, Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) might be widespread before it is detected, in which case the life expectancy could be short.  Another slow form is low-grade NHL. It may take many years before it gets worse and needs treatment. For another form, follicular lymphoma, the survival rate at five years is 80-90% and medial survival is approximately 10-12 years.
165||Call your doctor if the elbow is injured or deformed, you cannot use it or bend or dtrighten, it is swollen or you have fever. Your doctor might recommend RICE: rest, ice, compressing the elbow with a bandage and elevating it about your heart level. Ibuprofen or naproxen will reduce pain. Your doctor might recommend antibiotics, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, manipulation and surgery , as the last resort.
166||Your doctors will thoroughly examine your eyes to diagnose dry eye. For temporary relief of irritation caused by dryness, they may recommend artificial tears and lubricants, such as Clear Eyes®  or Murine Tears®
169||Testicular pain can be caused by testicular torsion, inguinal hernia, Infection of the testis,  a disorder in the abdomen, e.g. kidney stone or appendicitis, or Injury. Infrequently, scrotal pain can be caused by testicular cancer, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and necrotizing infection in the perianal area.
170||Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder in which children have developmental delays, speech impairment, intellectual disability, problems with movement and balance, and seizures. Affected children may have small head size, happy  demeanor, hyperactivity, a short attention span, fascination with water, difficulty sleeping, unusually fair skin with light-colored hair, and scoliosis. individuals with Angelman syndrome   have nearly normal life spans and  do not have developmental regression as they age.  Treatment helps managing  problems caused by the condition, e.g., physical therapy could help with walking problems.
174||Norwegian scabies, also called crusted scabies, is particularly hard to treat and needs to br treated aggressively, otherwise future re-infections are possible, particularly in crowded conditions, such as nursing homes, or other places where clothes, towels and bedding are shared. Topical insecticides and oral Ivermectin need to be applied repeatedly  for several weeks or longer, with the patient in a private room.
175||In some cases, treating the health problem that causes hair loss treats hair loss too. In other cases, medicine for male or female pattern baldness is needed for about a year. Hair transplants can be used to move hair follicles to the bald area. For temporary hair loss, e.g. due to chemotherapy, wigs could be used.
176||Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited eye diseases that destroys cells in the retina, causing progressive vision loss.  No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa.  The existing treatments aim to slow the progression of disease, whereas some experimental treatments aim to restore the retinal cell function or bypass or replace  the retina. Vitamin A is considered as a possible treatment with relatively weak effect, but too much vitamin A can be toxic. Other explored and approved medications include DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish; lutein plus zeaxanthin supplements; and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The latter (usually acetazolamide or dorzolamide) are given by mouth or as eye drops to people who have swelling of the retina. The experimental treatments include gene therapy with voretigene neparovovec-ryzl  that might restore some vision loss caused by specific mutations; retinal transplantation, retinal prosthesis, i.e. computer chips  that transform light into signals, as retina would do; and injection  of stem cells into the retina. For people in whom the disease causes swelling of the retina,
178||The most common causes of leg cramps are dehydration and low amounts of  potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium in the blood. Some medications, muscle fatigue due to too much exercise or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time can also cause cramps. Some leg pain can. be confused with cramps, e.g., due to injury, blood clots, varicose veins, peripheral arterial disease, inflammation or nerve damage due to diabetes or smoking. Some disorders cause symptoms that mimic muscle cramps:   involuntary muscle contractions; continuous or periodic spasms of muscles, and illusory muscle cramps. These people feel as if they are having cramps but no muscle contraction occurs.
180||Colitis is an inflammation of the colon. It can be caused by infection due to viruses, bacteria or parasites; or lack of blood flow (ischemic colitis) Crohn's disease, or celiac disease may have symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis. A physical examination, biopsy, colonoscopy,  CT scan, MR, and stool tests can help determine the cause of colitis. If you have ulcerative colitis, your doctor will tell you how often you need diagnostic screening for colon cancer. If diagnosed early, colon cancer is curable. The outlook for colitis depends on the cause. Ulcerative colitis can be controlled with medicines or surgery. Viral, bacterial and parasitic colitis can be cured with medicines.
181||Pain in one or both ears in adults may be caused by ear infection, arthritis, injury, ear wax buildup, or be "referred" from the teeth, temporomandibular joint, sinuses or the throat. Swelling of i the sinuses behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes could cause sinus headaches.  Temporal arteritis due to swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to parts of the head, temple, and neck area could also cause headaches. The most common type of headache are tension headaches caused by tightness of the shoulder, neck, or head muscles. Migraine headache may start on one side of the head. Cluster headaches are sharp and occur several times a day for several months.
182||Treatments for osteoarthritis, the most common type of knee arthritis, include pain medication, e.g., aspirin and acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, and injections of corticosteroids into the knee joint. A combination of nutritional supplements glucosamine and chondroitin may help. Another type of knee arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, might need additional medications such as disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs. General tips for protecting your knees include: avoiding excessive, repeated motions; exercises to improve movement and strengthen the muscles. Weight loss to relieve the stress on the knee joint. Stretching before  and after exercising, Wearing properly fitting shoes and replacing running with other exercise, such and cycling or swimming.
183||Abscess forms when the duct of  Bartholin  gland gets blocked.   Soaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can help the abscess drain on its own. The opening might close quickly and the abscess may recur. A minor surgery called marsupialization  involves creating an elliptical opening along the cyst to help the gland drain. After the surgery, practice good hygiene and avoid constipation by drinking fluids and eating fiber. It is important to treat vaginal infection. If the obsesses keep coming back, your doctor may recommend removing there glands.
184||A gastrostomy  tube is inserted through the skin and the stomach wall. The stomach is closed around the tube with stitches. if your doctor has not  told you if you need the stitches removed, contact your doctor.
185||It is often not clear what causes trigeminal neuralgia. Some of the known causes include  multiple sclerosis and other diseases that damage the protective covering of the nerves, pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel, tumor or injury. Trigeminal neuralgia runs in families, maybe because of the way the blood vessels are formed.
188||In people with hypothyroidism, the body does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Women are more likely to have hypothyroidism. This disorder can almost always be completely controlled with synthetic thyroxine. It is very important to take these pills as instructed.  Your doctor will find the exact dose you need. Tell your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking, as they may interfere with the levels of thyroid hormone. It is also important to eat a balanced diet. If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can cause anemia, heart failure, confusion, stupor, and coma.
190||Usher syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects both hearing and vision. Because nine genes may be involved, genetic tests  are not routinely conducted.  Genetic testing for some of the  genes is available; for some other genes there may be clinical research studies.  Diagnosis of Usher syndrome includes evaluation of hearing, balance, and vision. Vision tests include a visual field test, an electroretinogram, and a retinal examination. It is important to diagnose Usher syndrome as soon as possible, so that the child can start special educational to prepare for the loss of hearing and vision. There is no cure. Hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some people. Training, such as Braille instruction, low-vision services, sign language, and auditory training, during the first few years of life can take advantage of the time during brain is most receptive to learning.
191||Junctional epidermolysis bullosa causes the skin to blister easily. The treatments with antibiotic ointments are  preventing blisters, skin infections, and complications. Sometimes regular whirlpool therapy and oral corticosteroids are needed.  Other  features of junctional epidermolysis bullosa include alopecia, malformed fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel.  To take care of the teeth, regular  dental check-ups are needed. Healthy nutrition is important to help the skin heal. Crunchy foods that can damage oral mucosa should be avoided. Physical therapy can keep the joints and muscles healthy. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove deep sores and other deformities. Researchers  are exploring gene therapy and interferon treatments.
192||Arthritis treatments aim to reduce swelling, maintain movements in the joints, relieve pain, and prevent complications. Alternative and complementary approached to treatment seem to help some people. These approaches include acupuncture, special diets, supplements,  massage, magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. Acupuncture usually has little side effects, but sometimes temporary worsening of symptoms may occur. Traditional treatments include mediations, surgery, physical therapy, occupational therapy, maintaining healthy weight, massage and other muscle and bone manipulation.
194||Mild scoliosis may cause back pain if a child sits or stands for a long time. As people with scoliosis grow older, back pain is more likely. If scoliosis is worsening, it can cause chronic pain and noticeable deformities. Treatments depend on the severity of the curve. If it is mild, regular checkups are needed to see if it is progressing. Mild scoliosis is successfully treated with braces. Physical therapy may be needed to prevent scoliosis from worsening. Sometimes surgery is needed to correct the curve.
195||There are over 100 different types of arthritis. Arthritis that affects the spine is called ankylosing spondylitis. It can cause swelling and pain in the spine.
197||If diarrhea and smelly stool are caused by malabsorption, the doctors may need to treat the  condition that caused malabsorption. For example, infections diseases, such as tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics. In general, the doctors may recommend to adjust your diet. If only certain foods give you trouble, they may recommend avoiding these foods. If you are missing  digestive enzymes,  you can take enzyme supplements. Overall, they may try a  high-calorie diet that provides key vitamins and minerals, such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12, and enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The doctors may also recommend medicines to slow down the bowel movement.
202||Treatment depends on the size of the abdominal aneurysm. It may include blood pressure medications. Surgery is usually done if the aneurysm is bigger than  5 centimeters across or if it is growing quickly. Your doctor may need to monitor the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound every 6 months. Discuss with your  doctor if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of aneurism rapture. If you have internal bleeding due to aneurism, you will need surgery immediately. The outcomes are usually better if you have the surgery before the aneurysm raptures. There are two types of surgery: an open repair in which the ballooning portion of the aorta is replaced with a graft, and endovascular stent grafting, which is safer for older adults and people with other medical problems.
203||Treatments for chronic pancreatitis aim to relieve pain, improve pancreatic functions, and manage complications. Treatments may include a stay in the hospital for  intravenous (IV) fluids and nutritional support. If gallstones are  blocking pancreatic ducts, they may be removed with cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).  It is important to maintain a diet that includes plenty of liquids and limits fats. Eating small, frequent meals helps reduce digestive symptoms. Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements is also important. Your doctor may give you  vitamins A, D, E,, K and  B-12 shots.  Your doctor may also  give you pancreatic enzyme pills that have to be taken with every meal and snack. Doctors recommend avoid smoking and alcoholic beverages, as well as limiting caffeine.
204||Sleep apnea may be managed with lifestyle changes, mouthpieces that help keep your airway open during sleep, surgery, and breathing devices. To heavy snorers, doctors recommend avoiding alcohol,  sleep aids, sedating antihistamines, or other drugs that cause drowsiness. Snoring may be reduced by sleeping on the side or elevating the head of the bed. . Sleeping on their back can be prevented by special devices. It has not been demonstrated that the devices, procedures  and drugs marketed for snoring  relieve obstructive sleep apnea.  Doctors may recommend continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which provides a slightly higher pressure in the airway through a  face or nose mask.  Doctors may also   recommend losing excessive weight, stop smoking, treat nasal infections and allergies.
205||Pain in the joints is usually caused by arthritis, which is an inflammation that causes swelling and stiffness in the joints. Arthritis has many different causes, such as infection, or autoimmune diseases. There are also some disorders outside the joints that may cause pain around the joints, e.g., fibromyalgia or tendinitis. Yup doctor will recommend how to treat the cause of the pain. Pain that is not caused by arthritis may be reduced with rest, stretching exercise, warm baths, massage, aceteminophen (Tylenol) and  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen or naproxen.
206||Most people recover quickly after cataract surgery, which is an outpatient procedure. Recovery should take about two weeks. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving.
207||The average life expectancy for  people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome  is unknown. The outlook depends on the  specific features of the disease and their severity. One of the features of  Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is slow growth and development that starts before birth. The infants have problems with feeding which could cause failure to thrive and death during infancy. Muscle weakness may also increase the risk of chest infections and reduce life expectancy. If there are no severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures, children survive into adulthood.
210||Dietary supplements are not regulated by FDA. It is therefore hard to judge their safety and effectiveness. The information on the labels and websites does not have to be supported by studies. Supplements may be costly, not always helpful, and sometimes harmful The vest source of nutrients is a healthy diet. Before taking any supplements, talk to your doctor, a pharmacist or a dietitian.
211||Many adults have Varicella Zoster virus that causes shingles. For about one in three of them, the virus will become active. The recombinant vaccine significantly reduces the chances of getting shingles. In a 2006 clinical trial,  the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. Even if a person gets shingles after vaccination, the pain will likely be reduced due to vaccination. Side effects of the vaccination are infrequent and mostly mild, such as redness, swelling and itching at the site of injection in one in three people; and headaches in one in 70 people. If you have the signs of severe reaction, call your doctor or emergency immediately. these signs can start in a few minutes to several hours after vaccination and include hives, swelling of the face and throat and difficulty breathing, fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness.
212||Immure systems of people with chronic granulomatous disease do not function properly, which leads to frequent infections and chronic inflammation in all body systems. Treatments include antibiotics and anti-fungal medicines to suppress infection, interferon gamma injections to support the  immune system, and transfusions of granulocytes if other treatments are not effective.  The only cure is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A close relative whose tissues are compatible with those of the sick person may donate their stem cells. Before transplantation, the immune system of the sick person is suppressed to prevent rejection of the donated cells.
213||Bell palsy is sudden weakness and drooping on one side of the face due to swelling or squeezing of the facial nerve. Often the symptoms begin resolving immediately without any treatment. If you see your doctors within the first 48 hours, they may give you steroids to make full recovery more likely. They may also give you antiviral medications, e.g.,  acyclovir, and medicines to relieve pain, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen.  PThe doctors may recommend physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture. If your eye does not close all the way, you may get eye drops and a patch to protect the eye from drying out. Decompression surgery to relieve the nerve did not show benefits in most people. Even without treatment, most people with Bell palsy get better within several months. It may take months for the muscles to get stronger.
215||It is not clear how Ritalin produces its effect and how these mental and behavioral effects relate to the state of the brain. The effectiveness of the long-term use of Ritalin has not been studied. You doctor may recommend stopping the drug after puberty. Some of the known side-effects are headache, decreased appetite stomach ache, nervousness, trouble sleeping, and nausea.  More serious side effects include slowing  in gaining height and weigh in children, seizures, and changes in eyesight or blurred vision.  A clinical trial studied the effect of  Ritalin on the QT interval and found that the prolongation was below the threshold for  clinical concerns. Discuss the side effects and long-term effects with your doctor.
217||Part of a limb getting numb may indicate a peripheral nerve or a spinal nerve root malfunction. Your doctor will diagnose the cause and treat numbness when possible.  Treatment the cause may help the symptoms. For example, exercise may help with carpal tunnel syndrome, medicines that cause numbness may be changed, and vitamins may be prescribed if the vitamin levels are low. Do not take or change any medications or supplements until you talk to your doctor. Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand while handling something  hot or sharp. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries. You may also have problems driving.
219||To manage incontinence, your doctor may recommend bladder control training (lone or in combination with timed voiding and biofedback); life-style changes (such as losing excess weight, avoiding alcohol and caffeine); medicines that fully empty the bladder fully during urination, medicines that tighten the muscles to reduce leakage, controlling nerves around the bladder with mild electric currents. Surgery may help with leakage caused by a change of the bladder position or enlarged prostate. Leakage may still occur after treatment.
