5||Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). "UACS" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. If allergies are causing your cough, your doctor may advise you to avoid the substances that you're allergic to (allergens) if possible. Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. These drugs are standard treatment for allergies and postnasal drip. If you have asthma, try to avoid irritants and allergens that make your asthma worse.  The most effective treatments for asthma-related cough are corticosteroids and bronchodilators, which reduce inflammation and open up your airways. If you're taking an ACE inhibitor medication, your doctor may switch you to another medicine that doesn't have cough as a side effect. GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce acid in your stomach. You also may be able to relieve GERD symptoms by waiting 3 to 4 hours after a meal before lying down, and by sleeping with your head raised. Smoking also can cause a chronic cough. If you smoke, it's important to quit.  Other causes of a chronic cough include respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and heart failure. Treatments for these causes may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies.  Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort.
24||Primary familial brain calcification is caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is called SLC20A2, and accounts for an estimated 40 percent of cases, followed by the PDGFRB gene, which is mutated in about 10 percent of cases..The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon: 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction, 3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history.  For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered. To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. 
38||The recovery period may be as little as a few weeks up to a few years.  Most people survive and recover completely. In some people, mild weakness may persist. The outcome is likely to be good when the symptoms go away within 3 weeks after they first started. Some individuals still report ongoing improvement after 2 years. About 30 percent of those with Guillain-Barr√© have residual weakness after 3 years. About 3 percent may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack. About 15 percent of individuals experience long-term weakness; some may require ongoing use of a walker, wheelchair, or ankle support. Muscle strength may not return uniformly.
94||The choice of the appropriate treatment is based on the severity of the symptoms, the extent to which they affect lifestyle, and the presence of other medical conditions. Treatment options include "watchful waiting," lifestyle changes, medicines, or surgery.If you are over 60, you are more likely to have symptoms. But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.If you have BPH, you should have a yearly exam to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment. SELF-CAREFor mild symptoms: Urinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner. DO NOT drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime. Try NOT to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. These drugs can increase BPH symptoms. Keep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms. Reduce stress. Nervousness and tension can lead to more frequent urination. MEDICINESAlpha-1 blockers are a class of drugs that are also used to treat high blood pressure. These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. This allows easier urination. Most people who take alpha-1 blockers notice improvement in their symptoms, usually within 3 to 7 days after starting the medicine.Finasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate. These drugs also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH. You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better. Possible side effects include decreased sex drive and impotence.Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat chronic prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), which may occur with BPH. BPH symptoms improve in some men after a course of antibiotics.Watch out for drugs that may make your symptoms worse:SAW PALMETTOMany herbs have been tried for treating an enlarged prostate. Many men use saw palmetto to ease symptoms. Some studies have shown that it may help with symptoms, but results are mixed, and more research is needed. If you use saw palmetto and think it works, ask your doctor if you should still take it.
95||Ask your provider how much you can use the arm on the side of your body where the pacemaker was placed. You may be advised not to: Lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms) Push, pull, and twist your arm for 2 to 3 weeks. Raise your arm above your shoulder for several weeks. When you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your pacemaker and has contact information for emergencies. You should always carry this wallet card with you. You should try to remember the name of the pacemaker manufacturer if you can in case you lose your card Most machines and devices will not interfere with your pacemaker. But some with strong magnetic fields may. Always ask your provider about any specific device that you need to avoid. DO NOT put a magnet near your pacemaker.Most appliances in your home are safe to be around. This includes your refrigerator, washer, dryer, toaster, blender, computers and fax machines, hair dryer, stove, CD player, remote controls, and microwaves.You should keep several devices at least 12 inches (30 centimeters) away from the site where the pacemaker is placed under your skin. These include: Battery powered cordless tools (such as screwdrivers and drills) Plug-in power tools (such as drills and table saws) Electric lawnmowers and leaf blowers Slot machines Stereo speakers Tell all providers that you have a pacemaker before any tests are done.Some medical equipment may interfere with your pacemaker.Stay away from large motors, generators, and equipment. DO NOT lean over the open hood of a car that is running. Also stay away from: Radio transmitters and high-voltage power lines Products that use magnetic therapy, such as some mattresses, pillows, and massagers Large electrical- or gasoline-powered appliances If you have a cell phone: DO NOT put it in a pocket on the same side of your body as your pacemaker. When using your cell phone, hold it to your ear on the opposite side of your body. Be careful around metal detectors and security wands. Handheld security wands may interfere with your pacemaker. Show your wallet card and ask to be hand searched. Most security gates at airports and stores are OK. But DO NOT stand near these devices for long periods. Your pacemaker may set off alarms. After any operation, have your provider check your pacemaker.
97||Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed. If your hearing loss is severe and of a certain type, your doctor may suggest a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places under the skin and behind the ear. The device picks up sounds, changes them to electrical signals, and sends them past the non-working part of the inner ear and on to the brain. Hearing through a cochlear implant sounds different from normal hearing, but it lets many people communicate orally in person and over the telephone, and perceive sounds in the environment. Assistive listening devices devices can help you hear in certain listening environment. Some hearing aids can be plugged into televisions or stereos to help you hear better.
102||no effective cure currently exists for people with transverse myelitis. The outlook for people with transverse myelitis varies. Most recovery occurs within 3 months after the condition occurs. For some, healing may take months to years. About a third of people with transverse myelitis recover completely. Some people recover with moderate disabilities, such as bowel problems and trouble walking. Others have permanent disability and need help with daily activities.  Treatments are designed to manage and alleviate symptoms and largely depend upon the severity of neurological involvement.  Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and cyclophosphamide.  Therapy generally begins when the patient first experiences symptoms. Physicians often prescribe corticosteroid therapy during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Chronic pain is a common complication of transverse myelitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe transverse myelitis who dont show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids. Some patients respond very well to intravenous cyclophosphamide (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia). It is very important that an experienced oncology team be involved in the administration of this drug, and patients should be monitored carefully. Ongoing treatment with chemical agents that modify immune response (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate or oral cyclophosphamide) can be considered for the small subset of patients that experience recurrent transverse myelitis. Individuals with permanent physical disabilities may benefit from physical therapy , occupational therapy and vocational therapy.
103||There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision.   if your doctor finds glaucoma, you can start treatment to lower the pressure in your eyes, even if you dont have symptoms yet. Daily treatment will be needed to prevent vision loss. Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eye
105||Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined.A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs.
110||When acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.Acrocallosal syndrome (or severe Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant , which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.
115||How long someone can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 is still under investigation.It?s possible for people to spread the virus for about 2 days before experiencing signs or symptoms and remain contagious for at least 10 days after signs or symptoms first appeared. If someone is asymptomatic or their symptoms go away, it?s possible to remain contagious for at least 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Some adults with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; severely immunocompromised patients may produce replication-competent virus beyond 20 days and require additional testing and consultation with infectious diseases specialists and infection control experts. Role of viral diagnostic testing (RT-PCR or antigen) to discontinue isolation or precautions For adults who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined above.
116||If you have long-term swelling, ask your provider about options to prevent skin breakdown, such as: - Flotation ring - Lamb's wool pad - Pressure-reducing mattress Continue with your everyday activities. When lying down, keep your arms and legs above your heart level, if possible, so the fluid can drain. DO NOT do this if you get shortness of breath. See your provider instead. Exercise your legs. This helps pump fluid from your legs back to your heart. Follow a low-salt diet, which may reduce fluid buildup and swelling. Wear support stockings (sold at most drugstores and medical supply stores). When traveling, take breaks often to stand up and move around. Avoid wearing tight clothing or garters around your thighs. Lose weight if you need to.
117||Pandemic Influenza outbreaks have been predictably unpredictable in the years since 1918 but always global, and needing a global response. One million people around the world died in a 1957 outbreak which started in China but spread globally. In 1968, another outbreak took 1 to 3 million lives.The 2009 Swine flu A(H1N1) pandemic, started in Mexico and spread to over 214 countries and overseas territories or communities. Researchers are always on the lookout, though, because the next outbreak could be far worse. WHO is working closely with Ministries of Health, regional and national influenza research and surveillance centres, and other stakeholders to develop a multi-layered approach to preparing for and responding to both seasonal flu outbreaks and pandemics.  the new strategy will support WHO Member States in developing seasonal influenza prevention and control capacities. These national efforts, in turn, will build greater global preparedness for the next pandemic. Globally, the strategy will focus on research and innovation. This will include improved influenza modelling and forecasting, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine.
119||Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min. Before being given zoledronic acid injection, patients should tell their doctor if they have kidney problems and what medications they are taking. Zoledronic acid injection should not be given if the patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant, or if she is breast-feeding. Before being given zoledronic acid injection, patients should tell their doctor if they are aspirin-sensitive.  If the patient had surgery to remove some or all of the parathyroid glands in their neck, or had sections of their intestine removed, or are unable to take calcium supplements they should tell their doctor.  Before you start Zoledronic Acid Injection, be sure to talk to your doctor if you: Have low blood calcium. Have kidney problems. Had parathyroid or thyroid surgery (glands in your neck). Have been told you have trouble absorbing minerals in your stomach or intestines (malabsorption syndrome)  Symptoms of scleroderma include - Calcium deposits in connective tissues
121||cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). Cefuroxime comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) for 7-10 days. To treat gonorrhea, cefuroxime is taken as a single dose, and to treat Lyme disease, cefuroxime is taken twice a day for 20 days. The tablet may be taken with or without food, and the liquid must be taken with food.
122||Sometimes one of your genes can go bad in ways that make a cell turn cancerous. A gene can go bad if: The gene was damaged by something you were exposed to (an environmental factor) The gene was copied incorrectly during normal cell growth Less likely, you inherited a cancer gene from one of your parents. Sometimes people in a family are more likely to have a certain cancer. A cancer-causing gene could run in that family.  Being around certain things can raise your chances of cancer, including: Tobacco smoke:  Asbestos (a mineral fiber used for insulation and other building materials):  Sunlight:  X-rays:  Radon (a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and can build up to harmful levels in basements) Some chemicals used at work (such as benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride) can cause cancer.Geography (where you live) can affect your chances of getting cancer. One reason is that people in different areas may be exposed to different amounts of carcinogens. Another reason is that people in different areas may have different genetic risk factors. Not being physically active. Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer. Being overweight or obese after menopause.Taking hormones.  Certain oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also have been found to raise breast cancer risk. Reproductive history. Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk. Drinking alcohol.
125||Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body. Lupus occurs when the immune system, which normally helps protect the body from infection and disease, attacks its own tissues. This attack causes inflammation, and in some cases permanent tissue damage, which can be widespread affecting the skin, joints, heart, lung, kidneys, circulating blood cells, and brain kidney failure, one of the most serious and life-threatening complications of lupus. heart disease  can be a complication of lupus.
129||You will need to check your catheter and bag throughout the day. Make sure your bag is always below your waist. This will keep urine from going back into your bladder. Try not to disconnect the catheter more than you need to. Keeping it connected will make it work better. - Check for kinks, and move the tubing around if it is not draining. Drink plenty of water during the day to keep urine flowing.
131||Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but they are often felt in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs. Numbness and tingling can be caused by medical conditions, including Diabetes. to prevent nerve damage or stop it from getting worse Keep your blood sugar in your target range as much as possible. Some people with nerve damage have numbness, tingling, or pain, but others have no symptoms. Nerve damage can also lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold.  If you don?t feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a cut, blister, sore, or other problem.  Pain in your legs or cramping in your buttocks, thighs, or calves during physical activity. Tingling, burning, or pain in your feet. Loss of sense of touch or ability to feel heat or cold very well.  Most people with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications.
133||Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Wrap the ice in cloth.  Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap. Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart. You can prop it up with pillows. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Steps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are: Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure. Cover the area with a wet cloth or bandage. Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible. Call your local emergency number (such as 911) or local hospital for further advice. Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. Surgery may be needed. You may need to wear a sling, splint, or cast for about 2 to 3 weeks while your elbow heals.
136||Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious. How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain. For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to viral gastroenteritis. Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to call a health care provider if your symptoms continue. Sometimes, abdominal pain may occur due to a problem somewhere else in your body, such as your chest or pelvic area. For example, you may have abdominal pain if you have Urinary tract infections Call your health care provider if: Waking to urinate more often continues over several days. You are bothered by the number of times you must urinate during the night. You have a burning sensation when urinating.
140||The risk factors for depression are family history, life experiences, and environment. Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. If you have depression, you  may  be going through difficult life events, such as physical or psychological trauma, losing a loved one, a difficult relationship with a family member or friend, or financial troubles. Any of these stressful experiences can lead to depression.  Depression may be related to changes that occur in the brain and body as a person ages.  Older adults may also experience depression as a result of brain changes caused by illnesses such as Alzheimers disease or Parkinsons disease. This type of depression can appear in the early stages of these diseases, before many symptoms appear. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression. It is more than twice as common for African-American, Hispanic, and white women to have depression compared to Asian-American women. Depression is also more common in women whose families live below the federal poverty line. Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, Postpartum depression,  full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery.  Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis. Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight.  Certain medicines and some health problems (such as viruses or a thyroid disorder) can cause the same symptoms as depression. Sometimes depression can be part of another mental health condition. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks. No test can confirm depression. However, laboratory tests may help a doctor determine whether depression is caused by a hormonal or other physical disorder. Diagnosis of depression includes a mental health professional asking questions about your life, emotions, struggles, and symptoms
141||There are different types of flu shots, including some especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you. In the United States, FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent are licensed only for persons aged 65 years and older. In addition to FLUAD and FLUAD Quadrivalent, one other flu vaccine is licensed specifically for people 65 years and older. The high-dose flu vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) contains four times the amount of antigen as the standard-dose inactivated flu vaccine, and has been associated with a stronger immune response following vaccination and better effectiveness than the regular dose flu vaccine in older people in a two-season randomized trial.
142||During pregnancy, your body makes special hormones and goes through other changes, such as weight gain. Because of these changes, your body's cells don't use insulin well, a condition called insulin resistance. All pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. These women develop gestational diabetes Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby.Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed in the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Managing your gestational diabetes can help you and your baby stay healthy. You can protect your own and your baby's health by taking action right away to manage your blood glucose levels.
143||Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious. Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.  Metoprolol may cause side effects. The following symptoms are uncommon, but if you experience any of them, call your doctor immediately: - shortness of breath - wheezing - swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs - weight gain - fainting - rapid, pounding, or irregular heartbeat Metoprolol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.
144||Lactic acidosis refers to lactic acid build up in the bloodstream. Lactic acid is produced when oxygen levels, become low in cells within the areas of the body where metabolism takes place. The most common cause of lactic acidosis is severe medical illness. Intense exercise or convulsions can cause temporary cause lactic acidosis. Certain diseases can also cause the condition including: AIDS Alcoholism Cancer Cirrhosis Cyanide poisoning Kidney failure Respiratory failure Sepsis (severe infection) Some medicines can rarely cause lactic acidosis: Certain inhalers used to treat asthma or COPD Epinephrine An antibiotic called linezolid Metformin, used to treat diabetes (most often when overdosed) One type of medicine used to treat HIV infection Propofol The main treatment for lactic acidosis is to correct the medical problem that causes the condition.
145||A variety of things can affect cholesterol levels There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol  Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. Saturated fat is the main problem, but cholesterol in foods also matters. Bile acid sequestrants  decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food
148||If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Having a heart attack increases your chances of having another one. Therefore, it is very important that you and your family know how and when to seek medical attention. Sometimes a heart attack may cause mild symptoms or none at all (silent heart attack) people with angina may have a hard time telling the difference between angina and heart attack symptoms. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle does not get enough blood. Angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It may also feel like indigestion. It is usually relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medicine.
151||A vegetarian diet does not include any meat, poultry, or seafood. It is a meal plan made up of foods that come mostly from plants. A vegetarian diet contains no animal proteins.  When following a vegetarian diet, keep in mind the following: Eat different kinds of foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy and eggs if your diet includes these. Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and fruits juices to get a full range of nutrients. Limit foods that are high in sugar, salt (sodium), and fat. Include a protein source with all meals. If needed, take supplements if your diet lacks certain vitamins and minerals. Learn to read the Nutrition Facts Label on food packages. The label tells you the ingredients and nutrition contents of the food product. If you follow a more restrictive diet, you may want to work with a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients. People who follow vegetarian diets can get all the nutrients they need. However, they must be careful to eat a wide variety of foods to meet their nutritional needs. Nutrients vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.
152||Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.  Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder. Symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome often include a characteristic high-pitched, mewing cry that sounds like a kitten crying. This cry may be heard immediately after birth, lasts several weeks, and then disappears. However, not all affected newborns have this distinct cry. An infant with this syndrome may have a low birth weight and a small head with many abnormal features, including a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. Often the infant seems limp. Webbed fingers and toes (syndactyly) and heart defects are common. There are significant limitations in mental and physical development. Many children with cri du chat syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities.
153||Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia usually begins in a person's sixties. Some affected individuals have elevated levels of IgM and lymphoplasmacytic cells but no symptoms. These individuals are diagnosed with smoldering (or asymptomatic) Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. It can be several years before this form of the condition progresses to the symptomatic form.Individuals with symptomatic Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia can experience general symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Several other signs and symptoms of the condition are related to the excess IgM, which can thicken blood and impair circulation, causing a condition known as hyperviscosity syndrome. Features related to hyperviscosity syndrome include bleeding in the nose or mouth, blurring or loss of vision, headache, dizziness, and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). In some affected individuals, the IgM proteins clump together in the hands and feet, where the body temperature is cooler than at the center of the body. These proteins are then referred to as cryoglobulins, and their clumping causes a condition known as cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia can lead to pain in the hands and feet or episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue in response to cold temperatures. The IgM protein can also build up in organs such as the heart and kidneys, causing a condition called amyloidosis, which can lead to heart and kidney problems. Some people with Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia develop a loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy). Other features of Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia are due to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic cells in different tissues. For example, accumulation of these cells can lead to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). In the bone marrow, the lymphoplasmacytic cells interfere with normal blood cell development, causing a shortage of normal blood cells (pancytopenia). Excessive tiredness (fatigue) due to a reduction in red blood cells (anemia) is common in affected individuals.
155||Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The most advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration is known as geographic atrophy, in which areas of the macula waste away (atrophy), resulting in severe vision loss. Dry age-related macular degeneration typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the dry form progresses to the wet form of age-related macular degeneration. The wet form is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted. The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly.
158||Stool that comes from your ileostomy is thin or thick liquid, or it may be pasty. It is not solid like the stool that comes from your colon. Foods you eat, medicines you take, and other things may change how thin or thick your stool is. If you believe a certain food has caused a change in your stools, do not eat it for a while, and then try again. Call your provider if: You have a discharge from the stoma that smells bad.
160||Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed: A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally. There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working.  The exact cause of the failure to make enough insulin is unknown.  Most likely, it is an autoimmune disorder. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. With type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk.  Some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action.  Type 2 diabetes is more common.  With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.
161||Without timely treatment, BL is rapidly fatal.  However, the majority of people treated with aggressive therapy achieve long-term remission.The outlook is poor if the cancer comes back after a remission or does not go into remission as a result of the first cycle of chemotherapy.  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) belongs to a group of diseases known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas (NHL). Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. MCL can become life threatening within a short period of time. Low-grade NHL progresses slowly and may take many years before the disease gets worse or even requires treatment.  If the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy, the disease can cause rapid death.
165||Call your provider if: You have a prolonged case of tendinitis that doesn't improve with home care. The pain is due to a direct elbow injury. There is obvious deformity. You can't use the elbow. You have fever or swelling and redness of your elbow. Your elbow is locked and can't straighten or bend. A child has elbow pain. Treatment depends on the cause, but may involve: Antibiotics Corticosteroid shots Manipulation Pain medicine Physical therapy Surgery (last resort) Your health care provider will likely instruct you to follow RICE to help reduce pain and swelling: Rest your elbow. Avoid lifting anything with your arm and elbow. Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap. Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart.  You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling.

169||Testicular torsion causes: Severe pain in one testicle and sometimes in the belly area There are a number of less common causes. Less common causes include A hernia in the groin (inguinal hernia) Infection of the testis (orchitis), usually caused by mumps or another virus Pain from a disorder in the abdomen (such as a kidney stone or appendicitis) Injury Dangerous disorders that sometimes cause scrotal pain include a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and necrotizing infection of the perineum the area between the genitals and anus called Fournier gangrene. Cancer of a testis only rarely causes pain.
170||Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood.Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual.With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as "coarse." Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal.
174||Crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies) is an infestation characterized by thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs.  Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals, child-care centers, and nursing homes are examples. Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes, towels, and bedding can sometimes spread scabies.  People with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent future outbreaks of scabies. Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections, is commonly used for treatment. Crusted scabies may be particularly difficult to treat. Patients with crusted scabies may be instructed by their doctors to remove scaling skin so that topical medications can penetrate the skin more easily. Repeated applications of a topical medication or combined treatment with a topical and an oral medication for several weeks or longer may be necessary. Patients who still have signs of infection after one month may need additional treatment. A dermatologist or infectious disease physician should be involved in the care of the patient and those with whom they have had close contact. Treatment of crusted scabies should be done in an inpatient or residential setting, with the patient in a private room.Treatment includes oral Ivermectin and topical insecticides.
175||Treatment for hair loss depends on the cause. In some cases, treating the underlying cause will correct the problem. Other treatments include medicines and hair restoration: Medicine for male and female pattern baldness, which can take 8 to 12 months to work Hair transplants to move hair follicles from a hairy area of your scalp to your bald area. Wigs often offer the best treatment for temporary hair loss (for example, that caused by chemotherapy).
176||Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss.   Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease appear to be relatively weak. Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish.  Current research is focused on the development of new treatments including gene therapy , retinal transplantation, and the use of a retinal prosthesis. Stem cell transplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missing enzymes and chemicals needed for sight. Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causing mutation is known and would aim to restore production of the missing or abnormal protein . Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly to the inner retina and brain, avoiding the diseased part of the outer retina.   The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition.  Vitamin A palmitate; Omega-3 fatty acid supplements Lutein plus zeaxanthin supplements  Sometimes, drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Sometimes, surgically implanted computer chips No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa.  People who have swelling of the retina (macular edema), drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (usually acetazolamide or dorzolamide) are given by mouth or as eye drops.A new gene-therapy drug called voretigene neparovovec-ryzl may restore some vision to people with a particular mutation, provided they still have some retinal cells capable of surviving and reproducing.People who have lost all vision or almost all vision can be given a surgically implanted computer chip in the eye, which can restore some perception of light and shapes.
178||Leg cramps are common.  Common causes of cramps include: Dehydration or low amounts of potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium in the blood Medicines (such as diuretics and statins) Muscle fatigue or strain from overuse, too much exercise, or holding a muscle in the same position for a long time.  Some disorders cause symptoms that resemble muscle cramps. Dystonias are involuntary muscle contractions, but they usually last longer and occur more often than cramps. Also, they tend to affect other muscles and may affect many other muscles, including any limb muscles as well as those of the back, neck, and voice. In contrast, benign leg cramps and exercise-associated muscle cramping tend to affect the calf muscles.Tetany is continuous or periodic spasms of muscles throughout the body. These spasms usually last much longer than muscle cramps and are more widespread. The muscles may also twitch.Illusory muscle cramps occur in some people. These people feel as if they are having cramps but no muscle contraction occurs.Hardening of the arteries in the legs (peripheral arterial disease) may cause calf pain (claudication) during physical activity such as walking. This pain is due to inadequate blood flow to muscles, not to muscle contraction as occurs with cramps. An injury can also cause leg pain from: A torn or overstretched muscle (strain) Hairline crack in the bone (stress fracture) Inflamed tendon (tendinitis) Shin splints (pain in the front of the leg from overuse) Other common causes of leg pain include:  Blood clot (deep vein thrombosis) from long-term bed rest Infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or skin and soft tissue (cellulitis) Inflammation of the leg Nerve damage common to people with diabetes, smokers, and alcoholics Varicose veins
180||Colitis is swelling (inflammation) of the large intestine (colon). Most of the times, the cause of colitis is not known.Causes of colitis include: Infections caused by a virus or a parasite Food poisoning due to bacteria Lack of blood flow (ischemic colitis) .Crohn's disease, or celiac disease may cause symptoms similar to those of ulcerative colitis. A physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. Endoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer.Biopsies may show changes related to inflammation. This can help determine the cause of colitis.Other studies that can identify colitis include: CT scan of the abdomen MRI of the abdomen Stool examination for ova and parasites People with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. screening can help diagnose cancer early and improve chances for recovery. The outlook depends on the cause of the problem.  Ulcerative colitis can usually be controlled with medicines. If not controlled, it can be cured by surgically removing the colon. Viral, bacterial and parasitic colitis can be cured with appropriate medicines. Pseudomembranous colitis can usually be cured with appropriate antibiotics.
181||An earache is a sharp, dull, or burning pain in one or both ears. The pain may last a short time or be ongoing.  Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called "referred" pain.Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection  The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw.  A migraine headache involves severe pain. The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs up to several times a day for months. Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes.  Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area.
182||The most common type of arthritis of the knee is osteoarthritis. In this disease, the cartilage in your knee gradually wears away. Treatments for osteoarthritis are: Medicines to reduce pain, such as aspirin and acetaminophen. Medicines to reduce swelling and inflammation, such as ibuprofen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Injections of corticosteroids medications directly into the knee joint. Exercises to improve movement and strength. Weight loss to relieve the stress on the knee joint. Rheumatoid arthritis is another type of arthritis that affects the knee. In rheumatoid arthritis, your knee becomes inflamed and cartilage may be destroyed. Treatment includes: Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles. Weight loss to relieve the stress on the knee joint. Medicines similar to those prescribed for osteoarthritis. However, you may need additional medicines such as disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs or biologic response modifiers to control the disease.  for a seriously knee damage,  Knee replacement. Cartilage replacement. Resurfacing the damaged cartilage. Treatment for other joint diseases is similar to the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  In recent years, the nutritional supplement pair glucosamine and chondroitin has shown some potential for reducing the pain of osteoarthritis, although no conclusive proof has emerged to date.  Avoiding excessive, repeated motions may help protect you against osteoarthritis.  Follow these general tips to help relieve and prevent knee pain: Always warm up before exercising and cool down after exercising. Stretch the muscles in the front of your thigh (quadriceps) and in the back of your thigh (hamstrings). Avoid running down hills -- walk down instead. Bicycle, or better yet, swim instead of run.  Run on a smooth, soft surface, such as a track, instead of on cement or pavement.   Wear shoes that fit properly and are in good condition. This will help maintain balance and leg alignment when walking or running. Flat feet or over-pronated feet (feet that roll inward) can cause knee problems. People can often reduce some of these problems by wearing special shoe inserts (orthotics)
183||A Bartholin abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening. Soaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. It can also help the abscess open and drain on its own. However, the opening is often very small and closes quickly. Therefore, the abscess often returns.  Women can  be treated with a minor surgery called marsupialization. The procedure involves creating an elliptical opening along the cyst to help the gland drain.  Practice good hygiene. Eat soft or liquid foods until the abscess has healed.Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help. The chance of a full recovery is excellent. The abscesses may return in few cases.It is important to treat any vaginal infection that is diagnosed at the same time as the abscess.  Your provider may recommend that the glands be completely removed if abscesses keep coming back.
184||A gastrostomy feeding tube insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach. The G-tube is inserted through cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. The doctor uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube.Your provider should  tell you when you need to have a wound checked and the stitches removed. If not, contact your provider for an appointment.
185||Trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering myelin of the nerves Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor Injury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery Often, no exact cause is found. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation.
188||Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the needs.  Women are much more likely than men to develop hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can almost always be completely controlled with synthetic thyroxine, as long as the recommended dose is taken every day as instructed. After you start the pills, your doctor will gradually adjust the dose based on your TSH level. It's important to talk to your doctor about medicines that interfere with absorbing thyroid hormone. Such medicines include iron, calcium, and some antacids. If untreated, hypothyroidism can eventually cause anemia, a low body temperature, and heart failure. This situation may progress to confusion, stupor, or coma.  Experts recommend that people eat a balanced diet to obtain most nutrients. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of dietary supplements, such as iodine, with their health care provider.
190||Usher syndrome is the most common condition that affects both hearing and vision. Usher syndrome is inherited, which means that it is passed from parents to their children through genes. So far, 11 genetic loci (a segment of chromosome on which a certain gene is located) have been found to cause Usher syndrome, and nine genes have been pinpointed that cause the disorder. With so many possible genes involved in Usher syndrome, genetic tests for the disorder are not conducted on a widespread basis.  Genetic testing for a few of the identified genes is clinically available. Genetic testing for additional Usher syndrome genes may be available through clinical research studies.  Because Usher syndrome affects hearing, balance, and vision, diagnosis of the disorder usually includes the evaluation of all three senses. Evaluation of the eyes may include a visual field test to measure a person?s peripheral vision, an electroretinogram (ERG) to measure the electrical response of the eye?s light-sensitive cells, and a retinal examination to observe the retina and other structures in the back of the eye. A hearing (audiologic) evaluation measures how loud sounds at a range of frequencies need to be before a person can hear them. An electronystagmogram (ENG) measures involuntary eye movements that could signify a balance problem. Early diagnosis of Usher syndrome is very important. The earlier that parents know if their child has Usher syndrome, the sooner that child can begin special educational training programs to manage the loss of hearing and vision. There is no cure. Tools such as hearing aids or cochlear implants can help some people. Training such as Braille instruction, low-vision services, or auditory training can also help. Parents should consult their doctor and other hearing health professionals as early as possible to determine the best communication method for their child. Intervention should be introduced early, during the first few years of life, so that the child can take advantage of the unique window of time during which the brain is most receptive to learning language, whether spoken or signed.
191||Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Other characteristic features of this condition include alopecia, malformed fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel. The goal of treatment is to prevent blisters from forming and avoiding complications. Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is. Take good care of your skin to prevent infections. . You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use. You may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have swallowing problems. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat. Take good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups. Eat a healthy diet. When you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal. Choose soft foods and avoid nuts, chips, and other crunchy foods if you have sores in your mouth. . Do exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile. Surgery to treat this condition may include: Skin grafting in places where sores are deep Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing Repair of hand deformities Removal of any squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that develops  Medicines that suppress the immune system may be used for the autoimmune form of this condition. Protein and gene therapy and the use of the drug interferon are being studied.
192||Your doctor will talk to you about the best way to treat your arthritis, based upon the type you have. Possible treatments include: Medications such as: Pain relievers that are taken by mouth. Creams or ointments that are rubbed into the skin over sore muscles or joints to relieve pain. Medications that may slow the course of the disease and prevent further damage to joints or other parts of the body. Surgery, such as joint replacement. Doctors who diagnose and treat arthritis and other rheumatic disease include: General practitioners, such as your family doctor. Rheumatologists, who specialize in arthritis and other diseases of the bones, joints, and muscles. Orthopaedists, who specialize in treatment and surgery for bone and joint diseases. Physical therapists, who help improve joint function. Occupational therapists, who teach ways to protect joints, minimize pain, perform activities of daily living, and conserve energy. Dietitians, who teach about good diets and maintaining a healthy weight. Nurse educators, who help you understand your condition and help start treatment plans. Rehabilitation specialists, who help you make the most of your physical potential. Licensed acupuncture therapists, who reduce pain and improve physical functioning by inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body.  Chiropractors, who focus treatment on the relationship between the body's structuremainly the spineand its functioning. Massage therapists, who press, rub, and otherwise manipulate the muscles and other soft tissues of the body.  doctors recommend treatments that: Reduce swelling. Maintain full movement in the affected joints. Relieve pain. Prevent, identify, and treat complications. Many adults seek alternative ways of treating arthritis, such as special diets, supplements, acupuncture, massage, or even magnetic jewelry or mattress pads. Although there is little research to support many alternative treatments, some people seem to benefit from them. Side effects of acupuncture are usually mild if the technique is done correctly, but the following should be noted: Temporary worsening of symptoms may occur.
194||Mild scoliosis usually causes no symptoms. Sometimes the back becomes sore or stiff after the child sits or stands for a long period of time.  People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older. Worsening scoliosis may eventually cause permanent problems, such as noticeable deformities or chronic pain. Treatments depend on how severe the curve is. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. In more severe cases, treatment should be started as early as possible and may include: A brace to try to keep the spine straight Physical therapy to keep scoliosis from getting worse Surgery to join backbones together
195||Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints. A joint is the area where two bones meet. There are over 100 different types of arthritis. Ankylosing Spondylitis is arthritis that affects the spine. It often involves redness, heat, swelling, and pain in the spine.
197||A problem somewhere in your gastrointestinal tract keeps you from absorbing one or more kinds of nutrients. Malabsorption can be caused by diseases, surgery on your intestines, or intestinal infections . These include: Celiac disease Tropical sprue Crohn disease Whipple disease Damage from radiation treatments Overgrowth of bacteria in the small bowel Parasite or tapeworm infection  You'll usually lose weight and have diarrhea and smelly stool.  Different causes of malabsorption need different treatments.  For example, tropical sprue and Whipple disease are treated with antibiotics.In general, if you have trouble with only certain foods, doctors will have you avoid them. If you are missing certain digestive enzymes, sometimes you can take enzyme supplements.  doctors usually try to adjust your diet to relieve your symptoms. A high-calorie diet may be tried. It should supply: Key vitamins and minerals, such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 Enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats  Those with damage to the pancreas may need to take pancreatic enzymes. Medicines to slow down the normal movement of the intestine can be tried.
202||Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm. If you have bleeding inside your body from an aortic aneurysm, you will need surgery right away.If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done. You and your provider must decide if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of bleeding if you do not have surgery. Your provider may want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests every 6 months. Most of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop.There are two types of surgery: Open repair - A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material. Endovascular stent grafting - This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear. This can be life threatening. The outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm begins to tear or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.
203||Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. Treatment for chronic pancreatitis may help relieve pain, improve how well the pancreas works, and manage complications. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids and nutritional support.  Your gastroenterologist may use ERCP to remove gallstones blocking the bile or pancreatic ducts. Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). combines upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and x-rays to treat narrowing or blockage of a bile or pancreatic duct.  Your doctor may give you enzyme pills to help with digestion, or vitamins A, D, E, and K if you have malabsorption. He or she may also give you vitamin B-12 shots if you need them. The right diet is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to keep a healthy weight and get the correct nutrients. A nutritionist can help you create a diet that includes: Drinking plenty of liquids Limiting fats Eating small, frequent meals (this helps reduce digestive symptoms) Getting enough vitamins and calcium in the diet, or as extra supplements Limiting caffeine The health care provider may prescribe pancreatic enzymes. You must take these medicines with every meal, and even with snacks. The enzymes will help you digest food better, gain weight and reduce diarrhea.Avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages, even if your pancreatitis is mild.
204||To treat obstructive sleep apnea, your doctor may: Give you a CPAP machine to help you breathe while you sleep Give you a mouthpiece that helps keep your airway open during sleep Sometimes do surgery on the back of your mouth to remove and reshape tissue Surgically place a device to help keep your airway open .Doctors will also have you do other things: Lose weight if you're overweight or obese Stop smoking Avoid drinking alcohol. Nasal infections and allergies should be treated. Hypothyroidism and acromegaly should be treated. .Heavy snorers and people who often choke in their sleep should not consume alcohol or take sleep aids, sedating antihistamines, or other drugs that cause drowsiness. Sleeping on the side or elevating the head of the bed can help reduce snoring. Special devices strapped on the back help prevent people from sleeping on their back. The various other devices and sprays marketed to reduce snoring may help simple snoring, but they have not been shown to relieve obstructive sleep apnea. There are several surgical procedures marketed for snoring as well, but there is little proof of how well they work and how long they are effective.People with obstructive sleep apnea,  benefit most predictably from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). With CPAP, people breathe through a face or nose mask connected to a device that provides a slightly higher pressure in the airway.
205||Pain in many joints is usually caused by: Arthritis Arthritis is joint inflammation that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The causes of the arthritis are different depending on whether the joints started hurting suddenly (acutely) or have been hurting for a long time (chronic).Sudden (acute) arthritis in more than one joint is most often caused by: Infection from a virus The start of a joint disorder or a flare up of a long-term joint disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis) Chronic arthritis in more than one joint is caused by: Inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus Osteoarthritis, which is the most common cause in older adults Autoimmune disorders The most common disorders outside the joints that cause pain around the joints include: Fibromyalgia Polymyalgia rheumatica Bursitis or tendinitis Follow your doctor's recommendation for treating the cause of the pain. For nonarthritis joint pain, both rest and exercise are important. Warm baths, massage, and stretching exercises should be used as often as possible. Aceteminophen (Tylenol) may help the soreness feel better. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen or naproxen may help relieve pain and swelling.
206||Cataract surgery is an outpatient procedure. This means you likely do not have to stay overnight at a hospital.Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Recovery takes about 2 weeks.
207||The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) for people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) depends on the specific features present and the severity of those features. The average life expectancy is unknown. Muscle weakness may increase the risk of having chest infections and ultimately may reduce the life expectancy. Many people, in the absence of severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures , survive into adulthood. People with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. Slow growth begins before birth, and affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). Many affected children die during infancy.
210||Because dietary supplements are not regulated as drugs by the FDA, their manufacturers are not required to prove that supplements are safe and effective. Consequently, few supplements have been studied rigorously for safety and effectiveness. just because you see a dietary supplement on a store shelf does not mean it is safe, that it does what the label says it will, or that it contains what the label says it contains. Furthermore, because the need to evaluate supplements in humans has been recognized only recently, much of the available information has not been gathered systematically or scientifically and so is difficult to evaluate.  Eating a variety of healthy foods is the best way to get the nutrients you need. Supplements may cost a lot, could be harmful, or simply might not be helpful.  Talk with your doctor, your pharmacist, or a registered dietitian. A supplement that seemed to help your neighbor might not work for you. If you are reading fact sheets or checking websites, be aware of the source of the information. Remember. Just because something is said to be "natural" doesn't mean it is safe or good for you. It could have side effects.
211||Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus. most adults live with VZV in their bodies and never get shingles. But, for about one in three adults, the virus will become active again. The recombinant vaccine significantly reduces the chance of getting shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine. Mild problems - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3). - Headache (about 1 person in 70).  Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.
212||Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare, inherited immunodeficiency that affects certain white blood cells . People with this condition have immune systems that do not function properly, leaving the body vulnerable to chronic inflammation and frequent bacterial and fungal infections.  Symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease usually first appear during early childhood but sometimes not until adolescence. Chronic infections occur in the skin, lungs, lymph nodes, mouth, nose, urinary tract, and intestines. People may have a bone infection (osteomyelitis). Pockets of pus (abscesses) can develop around the anus and in the lungs and liver.The lymph nodes tend to fill with bacteria and enlarge. The skin over the lymph nodes may break down and allow pus to drain.The liver and spleen enlarge. Treatment consists of continuous therapy with antibiotic and antifungal medications to treat and prevent infections, Interferon gamma Transfusions of granulocytes.The only cure for the disease is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Antibiotics, usually trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are given regularly and indefinitely to prevent infection. Antifungal drugs (such as itraconazole) are usually also given regularly to help prevent fungal infections.Interferon gamma (a drug that modifies the immune system), injected 3 times a week, can reduce the number and severity of infections.Transfusions of granulocytes can be lifesaving when the other, usual treatments have been ineffective. .Stem cell transplantation has cured some people with chronic granulomatous disease. Close relatives who have a similar tissue and blood types are the best donors. If they are willing to donate, they can be tested to determine whether their tissue and blood types are compatible with those of the affected person. Before transplantation, the person is given drugs to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) and thus help prevent rejection of the transplant.
213||Bell palsy is sudden weakness on one side of your face. It happens when a nerve in your face (called the facial nerve) swells and gets squeezed. Bell palsy affects only one side of your face That side of your face becomes weak and droops Often, no treatment is needed. Symptoms often begin to improve right away.  If you had symptoms for less than 48 hours, doctors may give you medicine called a corticosteroid that can make full recovery even more likely. Steroids, such as prednisone, may reduce the inflammation and swelling. Other medications used to treat Bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain). Physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used. If you cannot close your eye all the way, your doctor may give you eye drops or a patch to protect your eye from drying out too much.  Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve (decompression surgery) has not been shown to benefit most people with Bell palsy. Most people with Bell palsy get better within several months, even without treatment. But, it may take weeks or even months for the muscles to get stronger.
215||There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby Ritalin produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system. The effectiveness of Ritalin LA for long-term use, i.e., for more than 2 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.  Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty. Common side effects include: headache, decreased appetite stomach ache, nervousness, trouble sleeping, nausea.  Other serious side effects include: slowing of growth (height and weight) in children, seizures, mainly in patients with a history of seizures, eyesight changes or blurred vision. Talk to your doctor if you or your child has side effects that are bothersome or do not go away.  The effect of  Ritalin on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study. The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was  below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.
217||The pattern of body parts affected by numbness often indicates which part of the nerve pathway is malfunctioning: Part of a limb: Peripheral nerve or sometimes spinal nerve root malfunction The condition causing numbness is corrected or treated when possible.General measures can help relieve symptoms and prevent additional problems. Precautions to prevent injury are needed because people with numbness are less likely to feel discomfort. If hands or fingers are numb, people should be careful when handling objects that could be hot or sharp..People should be aware that they may have problems driving, and if they do, they should talk to their doctor about the problems. Your health care provider should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Treating the condition may make the symptoms go away or stop them from getting worse. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor may recommend certain exercises. Low levels of vitamins will be treated with vitamin supplements. Medicines that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. DO NOT change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your provider. Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries.
219||Bladder control training may help . Pelvic muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises) work the muscles that you use to stop urinating. Making these muscles stronger helps you hold urine in your bladder longer. Biofeedback uses sensors to make you aware of signals from your body. This may help you regain control over the muscles in your bladder and urethra. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder.  When timed voiding is combined with biofeedback and pelvic muscle exercises, you may find it easier to control urge and overflow incontinence. Lifestyle changes may help with incontinence. Losing weight, quitting smoking, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to alcohol, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help with incontinence. Choosing water instead of other drinks and limiting drinks before bedtime may also help.   Besides bladder control training, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. -- Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. - Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused by a change in the position of the bladder or blockage due to an enlarged prostate.Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time. There are bladder control products and other solutions, including adult diapers, furniture pads, urine deodorizing pills, and special skin cleansers that may make leaking urine bother you a little less.
220||Most girls go through puberty somewhere between being 8 to 15 years old. There is a wide age range when puberty starts. That is why some kids in 7th grade still look like young children and others look really grown up. Problems with puberty usually involve hormones. There are many different hormone problems that result in too few hormones so that: Puberty is delayed or doesn't start at all
226||Depending on the cause of dysarthria, symptoms may improve, stay the same, or get worse slowly or quickly. Rehabilitation goals depend on the cause of the dysarthria. If the cause is a head injury,  the goal is to restore and preserve speech.  If dysarthria is mild, repetition of words or sentences may enable people to relearn to use facial muscles and the tongue for correct pronunciation.  People are taught exercises that increase control of the mouth, tongue, and lips and are taught to speak more slowly and use shorter phrases. Poor control of breathing muscles may force people to take a breath in the middle of a sentence. Planning punctuation in a sentence can help. Doing breathing exercises can also help, sometimes by breathing through handheld assistive devices, which help dislodge mucus in the airways. Speech therapy is appropriate for patients who have no problems with cognition or thinking, but have problems understanding speech or written words, or problems forming speech.  You may need to be referred to a speech and language therapist for testing and treatment. Special skills you may learn include:To avoid conversations when you are tired  To speak slowly, use a louder voice, and pause to make sure other people understand What to do when you feel frustrated while speaking Surgery may help people with dysarthria.
227||At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles.  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated. The shingles vaccine is a safe and easy shot that may keep you from getting shingles.  You should get the shot even if you have already had shingles or don't remember having chickenpox.
228||Occipital Neuralgia is a condition in which the occipital nerves, the nerves that run through the scalp, are injured or inflamed. Occipital neuralgia is a distinct type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head. Typically, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. Some individuals will also experience pain in the scalp, forehead, and behind the eyes. Their scalp may also be tender to the touch, and their eyes especially sensitive to light. The location of pain is related to the areas supplied by the greater and lesser occipital nerves, which run from the area where the spinal column meets the neck, up to the scalp at the back of the head. The pain is caused by irritation or injury to the nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, compression of the nerve as it leaves the spine due to osteoarthritis, or tumors or other types of lesions in the neck. Localized inflammation or infection, gout, diabetes, blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position are also associated with occipital neuralgia. In many cases, however, no cause can be found. A positive response (relief from pain) after an anesthetic nerve block will confirm the diagnosis.

231||Damage stops progressing within 8 weeks. Without treatment, most people with Guillain-Barr syndrome improve slowly over several months. However, with early treatment, people can improve very quicklyin days or weeks. Most people who have Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) regain muscle strength within a few months after diagnosis and treatment. However, for some, severe muscle weakness may continue even after treatment. Some people may have a slower recovery from the symptoms of GBS. For these people, recovery may take a few years. About 30% of people who had GBS continue to have muscle weakness years after the first symptoms of GBS. Some people with GBS may relapse after an original improvement of symptoms. The risk of relapse appears to be higher in people who have had a later onset of treatment, a longer-lasting disease, and other medical problems occurring at the same time. Unfortunately, there is no cure for Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS). However, symptoms of the syndrome can be improved with treatments including plasma exchange therapy and immunoglobulin therapy. Both of these therapies can help prevent the immune system from continuing to attack the peripheral nervous system. In some cases, corticosteroids have been used to try to alleviate symptoms of GBS. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be recommended to help people fully recover from GBS.
232||Urinary retention is when: You can't urinate at all or only a little  Causes include: Problems with your bladder muscles Something blocking your bladders opening, such as a kidney stone or enlarged prostate gland Severe constipation (fecal impaction) Nerve problems to your bladder (these can happen in people with health problems such as diabetes or Parkinson disease) Certain medicines  If you cant urinate at all, doctors will insert a catheter into your bladder right away to drain the urine. To treat the cause of your urinary retention, doctors may: Have you stop any medicines that may be causing the problem If youre a man with an enlarged prostate, treat it with surgery or medicines Prescribe medicine to relax the muscles at the opening of your bladder If you have nerve problems, have you put a catheter in your bladder several times a day to drain urine
234||Primary orthostatic tremor  causes unsteadiness when standing still. The tremor is sometimes described as having shaky legs, and it improves or disappears when walking, sitting, or lying down.Treatment usually involves medications used to control seizures (anticonvulsants) such as clonazepam or gabapentin. In some cases, treatment may include medications used for Parkinsons disease (levodopa or pramipexole), and/or botulinum toxin (Botox) injections in the leg muscles. More than one therapy may be tried before finding one that helps.  Surgery may be used for severe cases that do not get better with medicines. The most common type is deep brain stimulation (DBS). Deep brain stimulation is sometimes done when drugs cannot control a severe, disabling tremor.  To avoid triggers of your tremor: Avoid caffeine Get at least 7 hours of sleep at night Lower your stress as much as possible.
235||High cholesterol can also be caused by: Eating a lot of foods high in fat and cholesterol Having diabetes Not being active Drinking too much alcohol Taking certain medicines  Treatment includes: Eating a healthy diet more fruits and vegetables Losing weight (if you are overweight) Exercising You may also need medicine to lower your cholesterol.You want your HDL cholesterol to be high. Exercise can help raise it. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including Statins, which block the liver from making cholesterol Bile acid sequestrants, which decrease the amount of fat absorbed from food Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which decrease the amount of cholesterol absorbed from food and lower triglycerides.. PCSK9 inhibitors, which block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Fibrates, which lower triglycerides. They may also raise HDL (good) cholesterol. If you take them with statins, they may increase the risk of muscle problems. Combination medicines, which include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine  When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your health care provider will consider Your cholesterol levels Your risk for heart disease and stroke Your age Any other health problems you have Possible side effects of the medicines.
238||Causes and Features of Memory Loss Age-related memory changes (age-associated memory impairment) Occasional forgetfulness of such things as names or the location of car keys No effect on thinking, other mental functions, or the ability to do daily activities  Mild cognitive impairment Memory loss that is more severe than expected for a person's age, particularly difficulty remembering recent events and conversations (short-term memory loss)  Dementia Memory loss that becomes worse as time passes, eventually with no awareness of the loss Many disorders can cause a deterioration of mental function that resembles dementia. They include the following: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (due to excess fluid around the brain) Subdural hematomas (pockets of blood under the outer layer of the membranes covering the brain) Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) Vitamin B12 deficiency  Doctors can usually determine whether the cause is age-related changes, mild cognitive impairment, or early dementia based on the type of memory loss and the symptoms that accompany it.
239||Turner syndrome is a rare genetic condition . This condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 newborn girls worldwide, but it is much more common among pregnancies that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).
