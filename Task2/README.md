https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021

Training Data: The [MEDIQA-AnS Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00667-z) could be used for training. Participants can use available external resources such existing [medical QA datasets](https://github.com/abachaa/Existing-Medical-QA-Datasets). 

Validation and Test Sets: The original answers will be generated by the medical QA system [CHiQA](https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/) which searches for answers from only trustworthy [medical information sources](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3119-4). The summaries will be created manually by experts in medical informatics. 

The validation set will be available on January 29, 2021.

The test set will be available for the registered participants with the official MEDIQA 2021 test sets on [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mediqa-2021/problems/mediqa-2021-multi-answer-summarization), under the [Resources](https://www.aicrowd.com/clef_tasks/41/task_dataset_files?challenge_id=645) section.
