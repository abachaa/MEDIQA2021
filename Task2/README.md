MEDIQA @ NAACL-BioNLP 2021 -- Task 2: Multi-answer summarization

https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2021

**Training Data**

The [MEDIQA-AnS Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00667-z) could be used for training. 

Participants can use available external resources such as existing [medical QA datasets](https://github.com/abachaa/Existing-Medical-QA-Datasets). 


**Validation and Test Sets**

The original answers are generated by the consumer health question answering system [CHiQA](https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/) which searches for answers from only trustworthy [medical information sources](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3119-4).  The summaries are manually created by medical experts. 

- The **validation set** contains 192 [answers](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Validation/MEDIQA2021_Task2_ValidationSet_Answers.xlsx) associated with 50 [questions](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Validation/MEDIQA2021_Task2_VAlidationSet_ShortQuestions.txt). Each question has at least two answers and their summaries.  For each question, we provide two types of summaries:  [extractive](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Validation/MEDIQA2021_Task2_ValidationSet_MultiExtractiveSummaries.txt) and [abstractive](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Validation/MEDIQA2021_Task2_ValidationSet_MultiAbstrativeSummaries.txt). We encourage the use of all types of summarization approaches (extractive, abstractive, and hybrid). We will also provide the **questions** in the official test set as they can be used as additional inputs for the summarization models.
 
- The **test set** contains 303 [answers](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Test/MEDIQA2021_Task2_MAS_TestSet_Answers.xlsx) associated with 80 [questions](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Test/MEDIQA2021_Task2_MAS_TestSet_shortQuestions.txt). For each test question, we provide two reference summaries: [extractive](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Test/MEDIQA2021_Task2_TestSet_MultiExtractiveSummaries.txt) and [abstractive](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA2021/blob/main/Task2/Test/MEDIQA2021_Task2_TestSet_MultiAbstrativeSummaries.txt). ** In the official competiton, we used the abstractive reference summaries to evaluate the abstractive participating systems and the extractive summaries to evaluation the extractive systems (only extractive summaries were used on [AIcrowd-Task2](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mediqa-2021/problems/mediqa-2021-multi-answer-summarization-mas/leaderboards?challenge_round_id=741)).
