Evaluation: 
------------------
- The [AIcrowd platform](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mediqa-2021) will be used for releasing the test sets and submitting runs. 

- [ROUGE](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013.pdf) will be used as the main metric to rank the participating teams, but we will also use several evaluation metrics more adapted to each task such as [HOLMS](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.498.pdf) and [CheXbert](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09167.pdf).
